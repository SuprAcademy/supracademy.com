## Keeping Students Engaged During The Pandemic -- Doing Our Part 

![exam_time.jpg]({{"/assets/posts/FreeSessions2020_04.jpg"}})

Hello Parents,

As you know, we have moved all of our tutoring sessions online starting in September of last year. With most people confined to their homes and students being out of school indefinitely, there has never been a better time to make the best use of online tutoring and online lessons. In addition to keeping students engaged for a few hours during the day, online sessions also offer the opportunity for them to catch up on their school work. And they do have some catching up to do: with lessons they had missed due to the interruptions in the past few months or with lessons they will likely miss due to the ongoing pandemic.

Given the current situation and the uncertainty we all face due to the pandemic, we've decided to do our part in supporting our community by offering all sessions within the month of April free of charge. We rely on the fees we charge to run our normal operations, but we also realize that everyone is going through an adjustment period and so parents could use a break as we all navigate through these times.

Please have a chat with your child, and decide if you/they would like to sign up for sessions with us.

How to sign up:
- You can follow the link below find a time that works best for your child to hold the online session. We will contact you as soon as we receive the request.

As always, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to follow up.

Yours in Learning,

The SuprAcademy Team
