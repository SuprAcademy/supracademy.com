                We are not in the business of selling boosting grades. It is not our primary goal. However, we will work with the student (and parent) to make sure that any math and/or science concept the student is having difficulties with is broken down into its most basic components and explained to student, that the student is provided with the necessary resources to help them understand math and science concepts, and that students keep up with their academic work. Though improving grades isn't our primary immediate goal, we strongly believe that, with our guidance, the student will boost their understanding of math and science concepts, which in turn will lead up to boosting student confidence and consequently better grades. In the years that we have operated SuprAcademy, we have had exceptionally high retention rates -- students keep coming back to our program semester after semester.

                Once we get to know the students through the Initial Chat and the first few sessions, we have learned a lot about their learning style, are familiar with their current subject work, and have established a good workflow. This allows for a smooth transition between offline and online sessions. Our interactive classroom, with its whiteboard, built-in voice and chat options, easy to use graphing and equation tools makes our interaction very smooth and efficient. Often times, we are working on follow-ups to our previous sessions. We don't spend too much time trying to catch up on what the students needs are or trying to understand where the student difficulties are.

                We do not have our own curriculum. Since we work on building upon individual students' daily schoolwork, what we have is the experience to adapt to each student's unique math and science learning needs and work with them on breaking down the concepts into their most basic forms and building upon them.
