                The one on one nature of our sessions makes it very imperative that students show up for their scheduled sessions. 48 hours notice is required to reschedule a session. 

                <p>If, for reasons that are outside of the student/parents' control, the student cannot make it to their scheduled sessions, please give us a call as early as possible and we will make arrangements to reschedule or make up the sessions. </p>

                Sessions missed without noticed are not eligible for re-scheduling/make up. 

                <p>There is no refund for missed sessions. </p>

                To accommodate each student's needs, we have a range of fee plans. The plans are based on the frequency of the weekly sessions and the grade level of the student. We work with each student and their family to work out the best plan for them. Enrollment to our program requires a minimum of one month commitment. Please see our <a href="http://supracademy.com/pricing"> Pricing </a> page for more cost details.

                Though improving grades isn't our primary immediate goal, we strongly believe that, with our guidance, the student will boost their understanding of math and science concepts, which in turn will lead up to improving student confidence and consequently better grades. 
                We will work with the student (and parent) to make sure that any math and/or science concept the student is having difficulties with is broken down into its most basic components and explained to student, that the student is provided with the necessary resources to help them understand math and science concepts, and that students keep up with their academic work.
