          <p>At SuprAcademy, we believe that the key to helping a student excel at their academic work is to focus on the individual student. Every student learns differently. So it is only natural to nurture each student’s learning capacity individually. SuprAcademy is a place where the concepts and problems learned in day school are the starting point. Everything we do revolves around the student’s regular academic work. We first analyze each student’s current status with their academic work, identify areas of strength and of challenge, and we move on to address the areas of challenge. We further nurture students’ areas of strength by providing more complex exercises and activities.</p>

          <p>Upon enrollment with SuprAcademy, an initial assessment of the student’s current academic work will be performed to assess and plan the type of help they require. Students will then be provided with an individualized online account that they can access to  upload, update and track their SuprAcademy work.</p>

          <p>Depending on the individual student’s specific needs, the services we provide include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Homework Help</li>
            <li>Lesson Review</li>
            <li>Exam Preparation</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Some or all of these are used as the starting point to help students achieve full understanding of the concepts under consideration.</p>
